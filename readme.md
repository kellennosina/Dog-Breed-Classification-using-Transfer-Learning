# Dog Breed Classification using Transfer Learning

## Overview
This project aims to classify different dog breeds using deep learning techniques, specifically Transfer Learning. A pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is fine-tuned to recognize and classify various dog breeds.

## Dataset
The dataset used consists of labeled images of different dog breeds. It can be sourced from:
- Kaggle Dog Breed Identification Dataset
- Stanford Dogs Dataset
- Other publicly available image datasets

## Model Architecture
Transfer Learning is leveraged using a pre-trained CNN model such as:
- **VGG16**
- **ResNet50**
- **InceptionV3**
- **EfficientNet**

The pre-trained model is used as a feature extractor, with fully connected layers added on top for classification.

## Installation and Dependencies
To run this project, install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn opencv-python
```

## Training and Evaluation
1. Load and preprocess the dataset (resize images, normalize pixel values).
2. Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
3. Load the pre-trained model and fine-tune it for classification.
4. Train the model using an appropriate optimizer and loss function.
5. Evaluate the model on the test set.

## Usage
- Run the training script:
```bash
python train.py
```
- Perform inference on an image:
```bash
python predict.py --image path/to/image.jpg
```

## Results
The model is evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, and F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

## Future Improvements
- Enhance data augmentation techniques
- Experiment with different pre-trained models
- Implement real-time classification using a webcam
